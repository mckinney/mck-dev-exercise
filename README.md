# McKinney Backend/Full-Stack Developer Exercise
The following exercise represents an example task that a developer working with the Data and Analytics team at McKinney might be presented.

## Instructions
Included in this repository is an Excel file that contains four sheets (performance, placement-info, creative-info and double-verify) with related data sets for tracking ad performance. It is your job to find potentially interesting anomolies within the data. You may need to combine, aggregate or split the data sets to perform you analysis.

To begin developing your solution, clone this repository and push all code that you wrote to achieve your analysis of the data.

## Requirements
1. You will need to create a SQLite database and a Python script to ingest the data from each of the four sheets into tables.
2. Write a Python module that is capable of reading data from each of the tables.
3. Write a script to perform anomoly detection on the data that imports the module from the previous step.
4. Update the README.md file with the necessary requirements and setup steps for using the anomoly detection script.

## Submission
Make sure your repository is public and all code changes have been pushed. Once you are satisfied, share the link to your repository with [matt.mcginnis@mckinney.com](mailto:matt.mcginnis@mckinney.com) so that we may have a chance to review.
